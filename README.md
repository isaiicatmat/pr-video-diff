# PR Video Diff üé¨

> A GitHub Action that **records two URLs** (base vs. preview) and generates a **split-screen MP4/GIF** to visualize UI changes in every Pull Request.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Add this action to your repository (e.g., in `.github/actions/pr-video-diff/`) **or** publish it as a standalone action.
2. Create a workflow file (see example below).
3. Open a PR with a deploy preview (Netlify/Vercel) and check the Job Summary + Artifacts.
